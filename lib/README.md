# lib

Modified source code of third-party libraries (`transtab`, `carte_ai`, etc.).

To ensure fair and reproducible experiments, we patched these libraries to use **unified data loading**, **fixed train/test splits**, and **standardized data preprocessing**. The modified code is kept here instead of modifying the installed packages directly.
